## 1 Introduction
In this assignment you need to pick one or two datasets from one of those available at the UCI Repository1 and perform supervised learning tasks (classi- fication or regression) on them.
The report task is mandatory and counts a total of 20 marks. The remaining marks are equally split across 5 learning tasks. For each learning task you need to pick a learning algorithm from a family of algorithms: decision trees, instance- based learning, bayesian learning, neural networks, and model ensembles.
Note that, the learning algorithms that you can pick do not need to be among those presented in the module. You can pick any that you like, and; whenever possible you should use as a target feature the one identified by the dataset. If this is not possible you can use another feature from those available in the dataset.

## 2 Instructions
To complete this assignment, you need to use Python and Jupyter notebooks. You should submit one Jupyter notebook for each task. Common preprocessing steps for the dataset and final performance analysis can be done in other Jupyter notebooks. You will be using Jupyter notebooks because these will allow you to code, document your code, and present results all at the same time. Please make sure to document your code and describe it also in the report.   

### 2.1 Report(20)
You will be supplied with a report template containing further instructions and indications of what to write. These indications are highlighted in orange. Please follow them carefully and delete them when you are done. You must use this template and its format should not be changed.    

The report will be evaluated based on its general quality, task description, data analysis, and final comparison of the trained models on the test sets. If you wish, you can add an image in the cover page. This template should not be used only to get a full mark on the this task, but also to make sure you get a full mark on the other tasks by presenting what you have done in a clear and satisfactory manner. The report has no word limit, but be reasonable.

### 2.2 Learning Tasks(5*16)

Each task will be evaluate based on the quality of its presentation, implemen-
tation, training, validation, and hyper-parameter tuning.
Note that you will not be evaluated based on the performance of the trained models; this assignment aims to evaluate your work and not the learning algo- rithms. The performance of these learned models is left to you to discuss in the report.

* Decision Trees 
* Instance-based Learning
